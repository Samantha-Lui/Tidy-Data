###Explanation###
The features selected for the original database came from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. Each time domain signal was prefixed 't' to denote time whereas each frequency domain signal was prefixed 'f' to denote frequency. These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

- tBodyAcc-XYZ
- tGravityAcc-XYZ
- tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
- tBodyGyro-XYZ
- tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
- tBodyAccMag
- tGravityAccMag
- tBodyAccJerkMag
- tBodyGyroMag
- tBodyGyroJerkMag
- fBodyAcc-XYZ
- fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
- fBodyGyro-XYZ
- fBodyAccMag
- fBodyAccJerkMag
- fBodyGyroMag
- fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are:

- mean\( \): Mean value
- std\( \): Standard deviation
- meanFreq\( \): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency


__Note__: Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].

__Note__: meanFreq\( \) is included because it is the weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency.




##Procedure##

The script was produced using R x64 3.1.1 on Windows 7.

1. Downloaded from "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip" and stored the zip file as "courseProject.zip" under the local directory.

2. Extracted "courseProject.zip" locally. The result was the file "UCI HAR Dataset".

3. Loaded files "activity_labels.txt", "features.txt", "./test/subject_test.txt", "./test/y_test.txt", "./test/X_test.txt", "./train/subject_train.txt", "./train/y_train.txt" and "./train/X_train.txt" from the base directory "UCI HAR Dataset" and stored them as tables.

4. Merged the training and the test sets using _rbind\( \)_.

5. Column numbers in the "features" table containing the terms "mean\( \) " or "std\( \) " were selected using _grep\( \)_.

6. A new table was subset from the merged data set produced in Step 2 by the selected column numbers produced in Step 3.

7. The activity labels were converted into descriptive names by linking it to the list of activity names using _sapply\( \)_.

8. There is an inconsistency in the features_info and features. Apparently the terms with `BodyBody` are artifacts.
   The expression `BodyBody` in the activity labels were replaced by 'Body' using _gsub\( \)_.

9. Activity column and subject column were augmented to the left of the table produced in Step 4.

10. The table produced in Step 7 was grouped by subject and then by activity and the average of each variable for each activity and each subject was calculated using _aggregate\( \)_ with the parameter _FUN_ = _mean_. The result was stored in a new table.

11. The final result was constructed from eliminating the original subject and activity columns from the table produced in Step 10.

12. The final result was output to "tidyData.txt" in where each quantitative entity was rounded to eight significant digits and expressed in scientific notation.
